# OpenId Client for Rust

| This is a work in progress OpenId RP Client and should not be used in production. Its not complete yet |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |

This OpenId Client is an effort to port an excellent OpenId Client for NodeJs - [openid-client](https://github.com/panva/node-openid-client) by [panva](https://github.com/panva).

I am a newcomer to rust, so if you spot any mistakes or want to help out, please reachout through an issue through the [repository](https://github.com/sathyajithps/openid-client).
